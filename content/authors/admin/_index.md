    summary: |
     SiN in as an umbrella organization for interest organisations for doctoral candidates and postdocs at Norwegian universities. We helped the local organisations at the individual institutions work together. However, primarily we work as a voice for PhD candidates and postdocs on political issues concerning education, research and other issues of relevance for the member organisations. My primary focus was cleaning up and managing a disorganised organisation with little financial control and little to no retention of institutional knowledge. In turn of policy, my focus as president was on improving the systems to take care of PhD candidates (and postdocs) who spoke up against people with tenure.

    summary: The committee concluded that the winning contribution was John S√¶ten Lilletvedt (UiB) and Ole Kristian Dyskeland (NHH) with the article ‚ÄúDo Capacity Constrained Bots Collude?‚Äù. The article builds on recent research investigating whether algorithmic pricing can lead to collusion, a topic of clear policy relevance. This is particularly timely given the increased use of artificial intelligence in markets and concerns that this may lead to worse outcomes for consumers. The authors simulate pricing outcomes in a setting where algorithms (‚Äúbots‚Äù) can learn and have capacity constraints. Although they do not find evidence of collusive outcomes, the setting leads to higher and more dispersed prices. The committee regarded this as ambitious and policy-relevant research at the forefront of the field.
