As president of SiN in 2023 I got to think about the role of PhD scholars in Norway. It truly is a weird system we have chosen. In this post, I present a model, or framework, I developed for thinking about the position of PhD Research Scholars. We're students, public employees, and researchers. Three distinc roles baked into one. Many of the issues Norwgeian PhD students report facing are not uniquely Norwegian, many of them are very common among PhDs everywhere, however most solutions have to be uniquely Norwegian because of it.
