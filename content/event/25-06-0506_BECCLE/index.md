I have three papers at the BECCLE Conference 2025, all three of my work in progress. I will present about two-sided platform competition with endogenous consumer homing in an uncovered market, Malin Arve will present '*Channel Coordination on Exclusive vs. Non-Exclusive Content under Endogenous Consumer Homing*', and John SÃ¦ten Lilletvedt will present '*Do Capacity Constrained Bots Collude?*'
