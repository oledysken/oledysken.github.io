We relax both assumptions to analyze how exclusive and non-exclusive content affect pricing and profit for media platforms. In contrast to the outcome in a covered market with consumer multihoming, we show that the consumer price in an uncovered market depends on both exclusive and non-exclusive content. If advertisers have a high willingness to pay for exclusive eyeballs, platforms prefer to provide non-exclusive rather than exclusive content.","tags":["Media competition","Pricing","Content creation","Market expansion"],"title":"Multihoming and market expansion: Effects on media platforms’ pricing and content creation incentives","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ole Kristian Dyskeland"],"categories":null,"content":"NHH master thesis.\nAwarded 2020 BECCLE master theses grant.\nPublished as SNF working paper 10/20.\nAbstract\n‘Media markets differ significantly from the regular product space in that media outlet differentiation is not immediately separable in n-dimensions. It is also the case that high effort costs of reading an article may put readers off from reading it, and instead read about a different topic where they do not have to concentrate as much on following along. In this thesis I present a ‘short-run’ model for media competition where the editor publish a news issue in three stages: first they invest in quality through the underlying journalistic effort behind a story, then they decide on the advertisement volume by producing the newspaper’s layout, and lastly they compete in prices on news stands. I allow two long run variables to vary between the outlets: the size of their advertisement markets, and the effort cost of compromise – the transport cost. It is this latter difference between the outlets which is of interest in this study. By using Launhardt (1885)’s model of spatial differentiation rather than Hotelling (1929)’s, I allow one of the outlets to have disjoint demand, they have demand on both sides of their competitor. This allows me to analyse competition in prices and quality between long-form newspapers, which often require more attention to read, and tabloids, which are often easier to read. I find that outlets which cover similar news stories will wish to differentiate vertically, but that this might also occur with larger distance between the covered stories. The harder-to-read outlet will likely choose to invest more in journalistic quality of their stories to improve their perceived shelf-price. Allowing for varying transport cost complicates the matter of product differentiation, but in the media space, given the subjectivity of people’s preferences, and the importance of quality authorship in information-sharing, it adds relevant insights on the qualitative decision making among media outlets.’\n","date":1596758400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596758400,"objectID":"57932f83e8b5a048a7d50d4db6039002","permalink":"https://dyskeland.no/working-paper/master-oppg/","publishdate":"2024-01-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/working-paper/master-oppg/","section":"working-paper","summary":"Incentive for media platforms to invest in vertical quality when the platforms have different teransporation costs.
